      Responsive design is all about designing for all sreen sizes.
      This seems like a lot of work to do. It is acually simpler than
      it sounds. The only barrier is that you need to do lots and lots
      of testing in order to get the perfect result. But, dev tools in 
      browsers are there to help. This site also considers responsive
      design.

  We use the Web almost every day. And, the "almost" that's just been used is -
  well, almost insignificant. When we connect to friends on social media, stream
  videos on YouTube, search for something on Google, and lots more, all these
  media are platform of the Web. Now we can see the need to understand how the
  Web works so we could use it more effectively and/or responsibly.

### The Web and the Internet

Some people take the web to mean the same thing as the internet. But they are not the same. The internet has already been in existence before the Web came along. 

The internet can be seen as a means of communication or a links that connect different devices. And the web? Let's take it to be the collection of information warehouses. One of these warehouses could be your computer.

If it's still not so clear, I believe **[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web)** nailed it: The World Wide Web, also called the Web, is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators, interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet.

Alright. Let's move on with the hope that everything is still okay.

### How the Web Works

<br>
Browsers are built to utilize the internet and the web. Though they are not the only tools that use the internet and the web.
Other web-based apps like Twitter, Whatsapp, Facebook also use the internet and the web.
<br>
Understanding how the web works is not usually always easy. This is because it requires the basic understanding of some somewhat complicated mechanisms. 
<br>
Mechanisms like **[routing]https://guide.meteor.com/routing.html)**, client-server connections, request-response circle (round trip), DNS, HTTP, URL, packets, bandwidth, TPC, IP etc.
<br>
All of these? Wow! This is huge. Seriously. But, no need to worry. We don't actually need to go too deep into those - just a basic knowledge.
<br>
Most people don't really care about all these things. Thinking of it clearly, why should they even care? Since there browser is functioning properly and the web-based apps that they use aren't misbehaving, why should they care about knowing how the web works?

<br>
Well, If I must say why people should care, I would say because they need the basic knowledge at least in order to proteck themselves and the interity of the web in general

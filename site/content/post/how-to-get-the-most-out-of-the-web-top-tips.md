  We use the Web almost every day. And, the "almost" that's just been used is -
  well, almost insignificant. When we connect to friends on social media, stream
  videos on YouTube, search for something on Google, and lots more, all these
  media are platform of the Web. Now we can see the need to understand how the
  Web works so we could use it more effectively and/or responsibly.

### The Web and the Internet

Some people take the web to mean the same thing as the internet. But they are not the same. The internet has already been in existence before the Web came along. 

The internet can be seen as a means of communication or a links that connect different devices. And the web? Let's take it to be the collection of information warehouses. One of these warehouses could be your computer.

If it's still not so clear, I believe **[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web)** nailed it: The World Wide Web, also called the Web, is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators, interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet.

Alright. Let's move on with the hope that everything is still okay.

### How the Web Works

<br>


Browsers are built to utilize the internet and the web. Though they are not the only tools that use the internet and the web.
Other web-based apps like Twitter, Whatsapp, Facebook also use the internet and the web.
<br>


Understanding how the web works is not usually always easy. This is because it requires the basic understanding of some somewhat complicated mechanisms. 
<br>

Mechanisms like **[routing](https://guide.meteor.com/routing.html)**, **[client-server connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clientâ€“server_model
)**, **[request-response circle (round trip)](https://www.slideshare.net/cczona/full-stack-full-circle-what-the-heck-happens-in-an-http-requestresponse-cycle)**, **[DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)**, **[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol
)**, **[URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL
)**, **[packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet)**, **[bandwidth](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/B/bandwidth.html)**, **[TPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC)**, **[IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address)** etc.
<br>

All of these? Wow! This is huge. Seriously. But, no need to worry. We don't actually need to go too deep into those - just a basic knowledge.
<br>

Writing about all of these mechanisms is a waste of time. It's already been written by someone else.So, I encourage you to go over any of these that you feel is important to you.

Most people don't really care about all these things. Thinking of it clearly, why should they even care? Since there browser is functioning properly and the web-based apps that they use aren't misbehaving, why should they care about knowing how the web works?
<br>

Well, If I must say why people should care, I would say because they need the basic knowledge at least in order to protect themselves and the integrity of the web in general.

### Optimizing the web for better performance
This is just a basic development pattern than developers need to apply in order to developer fast websites.

This pattern is all about reducing the round-trip the browser needs to make before it could render page content properly. and, reducing the size of page contents like images, unnecessary libraries, plugins etc.

This is achieved by the use of inline styling and/or scripting where necessary, the use of compression tools like [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), [grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) etc. The use of [image sprites](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_sprites.asp) is helpful too.

### Conclusion and final though
I know this article is not the coolest one you could find but I believe it gives you heads up on what you need to know before you could properly understand how the web works.

Also the content in this article are kind of scattered. Just bear with me and take the part that interests you.

As always, thanks for reading and be sure to come back next time.

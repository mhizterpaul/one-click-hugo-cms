   =======
    The web is changing. At a very fast rate. New things come every year, month
    or maybe day. This calls for the need to keep up with these changes. And you
    know, keeping up with the changes means learning lots of tools - new tools.
    So, how are we going to do that?
about:
  heading: How to Keep up
=======
    We can keep up with the changes through lots of means. Which include:
    Googling, YouTube videos, podcasts, blog posts, news letters and many
    others. Sometimes, the noise out there might even prevent you from knowing
    the real stuff. There're too much noise,seriously. This again calls for the
    need to filter the information we get trough those means mentioned above.
    And how do we do this? The truth is that I don't know. I would tell you to
    follow your heart.

    Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

    The web is changing. At a very fast rate. New things come every year, month
    or maybe day. This calls for the need to keep up with these changes. And you
    know, keeping up with the changes means learning lots of tools - new tools.
    So, how are we going to do that?
intro:
  heading: What we offer
  text: >-
    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone.

    We can keep up with the changes through lots of means. Which include:
    Googling, YouTube videos, podcasts, blog posts, news letters and many
    others. Sometimes, the noise out there might even prevent you from knowing
    the real stuff. There're too much noise,seriously. This again calls for the
    need to filter the information we get trough those means mentioned above.
    And how do we do this? The truth is that I don't know. I would tell you to
    follow your heart.
